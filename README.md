## SETUP GUIDE

Step 1: Set Up Your Vue.js Project
Install Vue CLI: If you haven't already, install Vue CLI globally using npm or yarn.

bash
Copy code
npm install -g @vue/cli
Create a New Vue Project: Use Vue CLI to create a new Vue project.

bash
Copy code
vue create vue-todo
Navigate to Your Project Directory: Enter the project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd vue-todo
Step 2: Create the ToDo App
Install Required Dependencies: You might want to install additional packages like Vuex for state management or Vue Router if your app gets more complex.

bash
Copy code
npm install vuex vue-router
Create Components: Create necessary Vue components such as TodoList, TodoItem, AddTodo, etc. Implement CRUD operations for todos.

Style Your App: Style your app using CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

Step 3: Test Your ToDo App
Run Your App Locally: Ensure everything is working correctly by running your Vue app locally.

bash
Copy code
npm run serve
Test: Test your ToDo app to ensure that adding, deleting, and updating tasks works as expected.

Step 4: Convert to a PWA
Install Vue CLI PWA Plugin: Add PWA capabilities to your Vue project using the Vue CLI PWA plugin.

bash
Copy code
vue add pwa
Configure Your PWA: Update the src/main.js file to register the service worker and make your Vue app a PWA.

Test Your PWA: Ensure that your app works offline by testing it in an incognito window or using Chrome DevTools to simulate offline mode.

Step 5: Deploy Your PWA
Build Your PWA: Create a production build of your PWA.

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Deploy Your PWA: Deploy your PWA to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, or GitHub Pages.

Verify: After deployment, verify that your app is accessible and installable as a PWA.
